Approach for the project:

My first step was to import the libraries. After that I read the input file as a pandas object. Once these steps were completed, I started webscraping using the BeautifulSoup Library. From the input excel sheet i took the url's directly insted of hecking one by one. After i had scraped all the data, I generated .txt files for all the websites containing the output of the webscraping. After that I made directories for the stopwords, master dictionary, text screped from the web. I stored the stopwords from the stopwords directory in the set variable. I loaded all the text files from the directory and stored them in a list. After its completion I tokenized the words and then compared them to the data provided in the master dictionary, containing the positive, negative words. After comparing i stored them in the pos and neg set respectively. I created more lists for storing positive words, positive score, negative words, negative score. After that i calculated the Average Sentence Length, Percentage of Complex words, Fog Index, Average Number of Words Per Sentence, Complex word count, Average syllable count, Word count, average word length, personal pronouns count with the help of the formulas present in the text analysis document provided by the company. And after achieveing the results I exported the results into a csv file named 'Output_Data.csv' having the same format as Output Data Structure.xlsx.
